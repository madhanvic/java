JAVA

/**Case Sensitive**/
Java code is case sensitive.
This includes not only keywords and language syntax, but variable names and data types as well.

eg:
myLastOne is not the same variable as MyLastOne.
int is not the same as Int or INT.

/**Statement**/
Statement is a complete line of command to be executed.

/**Expression**/
An expression is a coding construct, that evaluates to a single value
int myFirstNumber = 5;
Expression is the code segment that is on the right side of the equals sign in an assignment or declaration statement.

/**Keywords**/
A keyword is any one of a number of reserved words, that have a predefined meaning in the java language.
keywords are casesensitive (e.g: int != Int)

/**Variables**/
variables are a vway to store information in our computer.
Variables that we define in a program, can be accessed by a name we give them, and the computer does the hardwork, of figuring out where they get stored, in the computer's random access memory, or RAM.

int myFirstNumber = 5; //Declaration

here,
int --> Datatype
myFirstNumber --> variable name
= --> Assignment operator
5 --> value that assigned to the variable

/**Operator**/
Operators perform operation (hence the term) on a variable or value
Addition, Subtraction, Division and Multiplication are four common ones.
